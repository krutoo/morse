Browser environment event sourcing tool for frontend micro services

## Motivation

This may be necessary when one page contains applications written on different technologies
(for example, React and Backbone) or when there are two applications on the page divided
into different bundles (separate scripts).

## Priorities

- ability to receive missed messages (that was sent before service initialized)
- keep messages sending order
- library small size (as less as possible polyfills)

## Install

Using **npm**: coming soon...
